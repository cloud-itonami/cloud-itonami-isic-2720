(ns cellworks.export
  "Audit-package export for social / regulatory hand-off.

  Produces plain EDN maps and CSV strings over a `cellworks.store/Store`
  snapshot -- the same append-only ledger, cell-batch-shipment drafts
  and safety-certificate drafts the governor writes. Pure data
  transforms only: no I/O, no network, no signature. The battery
  plant's own act is to sign and file the package; this namespace only
  materializes the package body.

  This is the honest delivery of the industry-stack `:export?`
  contract (robotics / audit-ledger capabilities) for ISIC 2720."
